# Security Policy

Unfold handles customer documents and credentials. Please report suspected
security issues privately so we can investigate them before public disclosure.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Email [hello@unfold.dev](mailto:hello@unfold.dev?subject=Unfold%20security%20report)
with the subject `Unfold security report`.

Please include:

- The affected URL, API route, package, or version.
- Reproduction steps or a minimal proof of concept.
- The impact you believe is possible.
- Any relevant request IDs, timestamps, logs, screenshots, or configuration.
- How we can contact you for follow-up.

Do not include customer documents, credentials, API keys, access tokens, or
other people's personal data in a report. Use synthetic data wherever possible.

Please do not open a public GitHub issue for an unpatched vulnerability. We ask
that you give us a reasonable opportunity to investigate and remediate a report
before publishing details.

## Research guidelines

Good-faith research should:

- Use accounts and data you own or have explicit permission to test.
- Avoid privacy violations, service disruption, denial of service, spam, and
  social engineering.
- Stop testing and report the issue if you encounter another person's data.
- Avoid persistence, destructive actions, and accessing more data than needed
  to demonstrate the issue.

We will not pursue legal action against good-faith research that follows these
guidelines. This policy does not authorize testing against third-party services
or infrastructure used by FileRouter.

## Supported versions

Security fixes are applied to the hosted service and the latest published
versions of FileRouter packages. Users should upgrade to the latest available
package version before reporting an issue that may already have been fixed.
